# Araucaria

Araucária is the popular name of *Araucaria angustifolia* is a critically endangered specie, occupying an original area of 200,000 km², from the 19th century on it was intensely exploited for its high economic value, providing very useful wood and nutritious seeds, and it has now lost an estimated 97% of its habitat., which according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) places the araucaria in Critical Danger of Extinction. It is a evergreen tree growing 50m tall and 2,5m diameter at breast height. Its life spans an average of 200 to 300 years, and can reach up to 500 years.

The tree was chosen as a symbol of the state of Paraná and gives the name of the city where I live, Curitiba (*curii-tyba, in tupi-guarani *, means "a lot of pine nuts", or "a lot of pine"). Due to species protection laws, the cutting of trees is prohibited by law and this protection. This measures generates a mix of love and hate for the trees: 

 > "In the past, the farmer would go to the field throwing pine nuts on the ground. His grandson, nowadays, where he sees araucaria growing, pulls it out, because if he lets it grow he won't be able to cut it. The araucaria, for him, will be a problem of space. Not even in backyards, in the city, are they planted anymore. And any species without renewal, even if it lasts 300 years — and some araucarias reach more than 500 — is doomed to disappear. Every year, 1% of araucarias die naturally. If not there is at least 1% birth rate, it will be extinct".
  
  Even with protective measures, trees are still felled mainly by the real estate sector. In 2021, an area of more than 5,000 square meters of A. angustifolia forest was cut down by a construction company for the execution of a large-scale real estate project in the Curitiba region.
  
  As there is no specific control by the city hall over the location of these trees, complaints are made by the population, meaning that many illegal cuts are not reported.
  
  
## Inspiration

  The idea of this project is to make the population aware of the importance of preserving and cultivating new species of Araucaria, understanding that there is an economic and environmental value in those trees and show the possibilities for ordinary people to enter carbon markets that today are almost exclusive to large companies. People who have Araucaria trees on their land will be rewarded with carbon credits referring to the offset of the Araucaria trees, based on the height of the trees, retroactive carbon offset tokens will be issued, which can be collected the first time the platform is used. Offset tokens for the previous year are made available.  
  
  When the population benefits and takes part as an agent of the green economy, the topics becomes part of everyday life, it is what fosters an effective transformation. The idea is to change the feeling of "economic loss" for having the tree on your backward, to a new vision about the benefits of having it, taking care of it and planting new trees.
  
  Research from the BIOFIX Center for Research in Biomass and Carbon, from the Department of Forestry Sciences at Federal University of Parana – carries out a detailed survey of all the araucarias existing in Curitiba. The trees were georeferenced using Google Earth Pro, identified block by block. So far, 9.876,00 Araucarias have been inventoried, accounting for an average diameter of 38cm, which means that most are adults.
  
  ## Mock
  
 For the model it will be used 15 private land of the Hugo Lange neighborhood in Curitiba, a neighborhood with lots of trees. Allotment data were obtained from <a href="https://geocuritiba.ippuc.org.br/portal/apps/sites/#/geocuritiba"> the GeoCuritiba platform </a>, made available by the Municipality of Curitiba.
 
 
 The focus of this project will be:
 
  * Mapping the Araucaria Trees per private lands using offchain data.
  * Emit Carbon Token for private land based on total number of trees.
  * The owner of the lands will be predetermined in order to reduce the complexity of this mock-up. For future updates the owner of lands can be determined using the data from GeoCuritiba plataform.

 ###  Hybrid Smart Contracts
 
 A hybrid smart contract is an application that consists of two parts: 
 
 
  * smart contract
  * decentralized oracle network
